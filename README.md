# Social Media Monitoring (SMM)

## Overview

The **Social Media Monitoring (SMM)** project is designed to collect, analyze, and display social media data from platforms like X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, and Instagram. It consists of three main components:

1. **Backend**: A Flask-based backend responsible for scraping data, performing sentiment analysis, and sending alerts.
2. **Frontend**: An Electron-based desktop application to monitor and analyze the collected social media data.
3. **User Site**: A ReactJS-based web application that enables users to access and interact with the system.

Each component has its own dedicated README file containing installation instructions, setup, and additional details.
